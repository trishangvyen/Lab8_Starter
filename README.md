1. How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related because they both work together to improve user experiences on different devices and network connections. Graceful degradation ensures that core functionality still works even when a device is older or cannot access advanced features. Service workers allow websites to handle caching even when you are offline. Both of these things improve accessibility and ensure anyone can access and use your website or software.
